Got it üëç I‚Äôll add that point in a professional, neutral way under the **discussion points** section. Here‚Äôs the updated MoM with the new addition included:

## **Minutes of Meeting (MoM)**

**Meeting Title:** Discussion on UI Component Library
**Date:** \[Insert Date]
**Attendees:** Client Stakeholder 1, Client Stakeholder 2, Dan (Component Library), \[Your Name], \[Other Internal Team Members]

### **Executive Summary**

The meeting focused on evaluating the feasibility of using the client-provided component library for frontend development. Dan from the component library team shared workarounds for missing components, such as customizing the date-time picker, table pagination, and multi-select dropdowns. While these solutions are workable, they may require design adjustments and additional development effort. The client stakeholders confirmed the decision to proceed with the library, with the understanding that extra effort and design flexibility may be needed.

### **Key Discussion Points**

1. Meeting attended by Client Stakeholder 1, Client Stakeholder 2, and Dan from the component library team.
2. Dan explained possible workarounds to address gaps in the component library.
3. **Date-Time Picker** ‚Äì Can be created by combining the existing date picker with multiple select boxes (e.g., hours, minutes, seconds requiring separate dropdowns).
4. **Table** ‚Äì Available as a sub-component within another component; however, pagination will need to be custom developed.
5. **Multi-Select Dropdown** ‚Äì Can be achieved using the *ba-filter-checkbox* component, though additional tweaks are needed for value population.
6. **On-Off Switch** ‚Äì Recommendation to use a checkbox or radio button as an alternative.
7. **Alerts/Toasts** ‚Äì Suggested to use the *ba-message* component.
8. **Icons** ‚Äì A wider set of icons exists beyond what is documented. The team can also create new icons on demand with minimal delay.
9. While these approaches are feasible, they may result in variations in the look and feel of the application. In other words, the design may need to be adjusted to better align with the capabilities of the component library.
10. Client Stakeholder 1 confirmed the expectation that the client-provided library must be used, even with these limitations.
11. It was also noted that implementing these workarounds is likely to incur some additional development effort.
12. Dan mentioned that he can be contacted for any help regarding the usage of the library or for requests related to new component additions, if required.

### **Decision/Outcome**

* Agreed to proceed with the client-provided component library as the base for implementation.
* Identified workarounds to fill gaps will be applied where required.
* Acknowledged that additional effort may be needed to implement and maintain certain customizations.

### **Next Steps / Action Items**

1. Development team to evaluate and document the additional effort required for custom implementations.
2. Work with the design team to ensure a consistent user experience despite adjustments.
3. Monitor and record any impacts on delivery timelines for stakeholder visibility.
4. Reach out to Dan when support is needed for using the library or exploring new component additions.

Would you like me to also draft a **short closing note** you can use when sharing this MoM (something like: ‚ÄúPlease review and let me know if I missed anything‚Äù)?
