Hi Team,

As part of Microsoft’s retirement of the SharePoint Add-In model and ACS authentication, I have reviewed our current application and evaluated the impact. One important clarification is that the ongoing effort is not just a UI revamp, but a complete UI re-platforming (React front-end + modern API stack).

After going through the existing solution, I have prepared a breakdown of the work that would be required for a full re-platform. There are more than 30 pages to rebuild (possibly more), and given the scope and complexity, this cannot be completed within the short period remaining before the SharePoint Add-In retirement deadline (April 2nd, 2026).

In our current state, we have two major challenges:

1. The application uses ACS authentication globally, which means all pages will be impacted when ACS retires.
2. Several pages use Add-In features directly, which will stop functioning after the retirement date.

Given these constraints, I propose a phased migration strategy. The first step is to ensure the existing application can continue to function beyond April 2nd, 2026. For that, if we migrate the authentication from ACS to Entra (formerly Azure AD), the current SharePoint application can remain operational while the new React application is being developed. This avoids any user disruption due to the Add-In retirement.

The core modernization effort will then focus on the pages that make use of Add-In features. These will be prioritized in Phase-1 of the React application, focusing primarily on pages that are both Add-In dependent and business-critical. The remaining pages can be taken up in subsequent phases based on complexity and business priority.

As part of this approach, we will require an experienced .NET developer/architect to assess the feasibility of implementing Entra-based authentication for the existing SharePoint solution and to validate integration design options for the new application.

Since the target solution is effectively a new application, we can take the opportunity to ensure that it adopts modern development standards, tools, and best practices. If any business approvals or compliance clearances are required for new technology usage, hosting models, or dependency changes, they may need to be initiated in advance to avoid blocking timelines.

The only limitation with this approach is that we will need to maintain two applications for a period of time — the existing SharePoint application (with updated authentication) and the new React application — until the full modernization is completed.

This phased approach removes the immediate risk posed by the Add-In retirement, keeps the application accessible for users, and allows us to re-platform the solution in a controlled and prioritized manner.

Regards,
Jithin

If you want, I can also give you a shorter executive summary version or a more assertive decision-oriented version — just tell me which style you prefer.
