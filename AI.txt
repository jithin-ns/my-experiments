Hi [Architect’s Name],

I had a discussion with [Manager’s Name] regarding the component library topic we reviewed earlier. She suggested that it would be good to have a discussion with the client-side architect and get alignment at the earliest, so that our deliverables are not impacted.

Would you be available to coordinate a call with the client architect this week? I’ll be happy to work with you on the scheduling and share the required context from our side.
