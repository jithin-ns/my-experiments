That’s a smart approach 👍 — you’ll want to keep the conversation solution-oriented, professional, and non-confrontational. Instead of positioning the client’s chosen library as “unsuitable,” you can frame it as:

It has strengths (acknowledge the client’s preference).

But for our use case, there are gaps that come with risks.

We’d like to explore better alternatives first, keeping their library as a fallback.


Here’s how you can frame your talking points diplomatically in the meeting:

Points to Present in the Meeting

1. Acknowledgment of the Client’s Choice

“We appreciate the suggestion of using [Library Name], and we’ve reviewed it carefully. It has several strong components that can add value.”



2. Highlight the Identified Gaps

“In our analysis, we found that some commonly used components, particularly form elements like date-time pickers, multi-selects, and notification systems, are not available or fully supported in the library.”

“These components are central to our application and appear in multiple critical screens.”



3. Explain the Risks Neutrally

“Rebuilding these missing components will add additional development and testing effort.”

“There is also a chance of design or behavioral inconsistencies, since custom-built components may not fully align with the out-of-the-box ones.”

“Over time, maintaining these custom components alongside library updates could increase overhead.”



4. Position User Experience as a Priority

“Form elements and feedback mechanisms are key to a smooth user experience. Even small inconsistencies in these areas may impact usability for end users.”



5. Present Options Without Closing Doors

“One option is to proceed with [Library Name] and custom-build the missing components, though that comes with the challenges I mentioned.”

“Alternatively, we could consider a more comprehensive library that already provides strong support for these components out of the box, which would reduce development effort and ensure consistency.”

“If required, we can still use [Library Name] as a base and supplement it with another library, but that may create additional integration effort.”



6. End with a Collaborative Note

“We’d like to align with you on the best approach that balances consistency, user experience, and delivery timelines. Our intent is not to rule out [Library Name] entirely, but to carefully weigh the trade-offs so we choose the most efficient and sustainable path forward.”

This way, you’re:
✅ Not rejecting their choice outright.
✅ Showing you’ve done a thorough analysis.
✅ Presenting risks factually (not blaming).
✅ Offering alternatives while keeping the client’s library as a fallback.

Would you like me to also prepare a short opening statement + closing statement you can use verbatim in the meeting to set the tone and wrap up diplomatically?
