Analysis of Missing Components in Proposed Library

After reviewing the proposed component library in detail, we identified several key components that are either missing or insufficiently supported ‚Äî particularly in the area of form elements and common UI patterns. These gaps affect critical parts of the application such as tables, date-time inputs, multi-selects, and notifications. Rebuilding or sourcing these components separately would introduce design inconsistencies, additional development effort, and long-term maintenance challenges. Given the breadth and importance of these components, relying on this library would create more overhead than benefit, making it less suitable for our project needs.

Component	Purpose	Usage in Application	Impact if Missing in Library

Table	Display structured data in rows and columns, often with sorting, filtering, pagination.	Listing screens such as user list, transaction history, reports.	Building from scratch requires significant effort for advanced features. Using another library may cause design inconsistencies.
Date-Time Picker	Allow users to select both date and time in one control.	Forms for scheduling, deadlines, event times.	Extending date picker adds complexity and risks inconsistent behavior. External libraries may create UX mismatch with other form inputs.
Multi-Select Drop-Down	Enable users to select multiple options from a list.	Forms requiring multiple selections (tags, categories, users).	Complex to custom-build (search, chips, keyboard navigation, accessibility). External solutions may not match styling of single-select.
On-Off Switch	Toggle for binary choices (true/false, enabled/disabled).	Settings pages, preferences, feature toggles.	Simple to build but must align visually with other form controls; mismatches can affect design consistency.
Alert / Toast	Provide feedback messages (success, error, warning, info).	Across screens: forms, workflows, transactions.	Alerts are simple, but toasts (auto-dismiss, animations) are harder. Inconsistent feedback styling may confuse users.
Icons (Flag, Trash, Edit, etc.)	Provide visual cues for actions, categories, or status.	Used throughout app: tables, forms, buttons, headers.	Relying on secondary icon sets can cause mismatched styles (line thickness, colors, sizing), reducing overall polish.


Closing Note
Considering the above analysis, it becomes clear that the absence of these core components will not only increase development and maintenance effort but also risk inconsistencies in design and user experience. To ensure a smooth development process and deliver a consistent, high-quality application, our recommendation would be to adopt a more comprehensive component library that already provides robust support for these features out of the box.

Would you like me to also make a slide-deck friendly version (bullet points instead of paragraphs and table) in case this needs to be presented during the client call?
