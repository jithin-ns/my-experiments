We're starting the migration of the existing classic SharePoint application to a modern SPFx solution. Since UAT is actively used by other teams, we'd like to avoid making changes there during development.

Could you please help us with:

Creating a new Modern Team Site (something like /sites/uat-cita-modern) for development/testing

Migrating the application-related lists (Department, Category with lookup relationships, and other relevant lists) from/sites/uat-cita to the new site

This will be used only internally for development and validation before we touch UAT/Prod.

Let me know if you need any additional details from our side. Thanks a lot!
