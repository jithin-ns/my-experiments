Here is a clean, management-ready paragraph that incorporates everything you just said, in the right structure and language:

To mitigate the impact of Microsoft’s retirement of the SharePoint Add-In model and ACS authentication, our approach will be two-fold. First, we will rework the authentication flow in the existing SharePoint application to move away from ACS and adopt Entra-based authentication. This ensures that the current application remains accessible and operational beyond the retirement date, preventing any user-side disruption. In parallel, we will perform an assessment of all existing pages to identify which ones actually depend on Add-In features and classify them based on business criticality. Pages that are both Add-In dependent and business-critical will be replatformed first using a React front-end and modern APIs, delivered as Phase-1. The remaining pages, which are either non-critical or indirectly impacted, will follow in subsequent phases. This phased modernization strategy removes the immediate risk posed by the ACS retirement, prevents downtime, and allows us to transition to the long-term React architecture in a controlled and prioritized manner.
