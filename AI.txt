Here’s a concise, JIRA-friendly RCA you can directly use or slightly tailor:


---

Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

The issue occurred due to a missing client-side validation for the input field. During development, the validation requirement was either not explicitly documented or overlooked, resulting in the field accepting invalid values. Since no UI-level validation was implemented, incorrect input was allowed to be submitted, leading to the reported bug.


---

Corrective Action

Added appropriate UI validation to restrict invalid input.

Ensured validation messages are shown to users before submission.


Preventive Action

Updated validation checklist for UI components.

Included validation scenarios in test cases and code review guidelines.

If you want it even shorter (one-liner RCA) or in a specific template your team uses, tell me and I’ll tailor it.
