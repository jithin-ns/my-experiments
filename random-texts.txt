Description:

Create a comprehensive Low-Level Design (LLD) document for the React + TypeScript UI application. The LLD should provide a detailed blueprint of the frontend architecture, component structure, data flow, state management, API integrations, routing, and reusability plans. This design will serve as a reference for the development team and ensure alignment with functional and non-functional requirements.

The LLD must align with the approved High-Level Design (HLD), UI/UX wireframes, and backend interface specifications (if available).

Scope of LLD:

Component breakdown and hierarchy

TypeScript interfaces/types

State management approach (e.g., React Context, Redux, Zustand, etc.)

API integration design (Axios/Fetch, service layers, etc.)

Routing strategy (React Router setup)

Folder structure and naming conventions

Reusability and modularity approach

Form handling and validation strategy (Formik, React Hook Form, etc.)

Error handling and loading states

Theming and styling approach (e.g., CSS Modules, Styled Components, Tailwind)

Performance considerations (code-splitting, memoization, lazy loading)

Testing strategy (unit/component tests)

✅ Definition of Done (DoD):

 LLD document created and stored in the project’s documentation repository (e.g., Confluence, Git repo, Notion)

 Covers all key modules/components and their interaction

 Includes diagrams or visuals where applicable (component tree, data flow, etc.)

 Reviewed internally by team lead or architect

 LLD reviewed and approved by relevant stakeholders (e.g., Tech Lead, UI/UX, QA)

 Linked to relevant JIRA Epics or Stories

 Clearly reflects scope, constraints, and assumptions

✅ Acceptance Criteria:

✔️ The LLD document includes a detailed component breakdown and the data flow between components.

✔️ All API calls and their handling mechanisms are documented.

✔️ State management solution is explained with diagrams or flowcharts.

✔️ The document explains the error handling and validation strategy.

✔️ Type definitions and folder structures are well-defined and align with project standards.

✔️ Routing and navigation flows are clearly described.

✔️ The LLD is reviewed and signed off by both frontend and backend stakeholders.

✔️ There is a clear plan for component reusability and separation of concerns.

✔️ Document includes a testing strategy and tools to be used.

✔️ There are no major open questions or ambiguities post-review.
