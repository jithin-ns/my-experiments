Dear [Supervisor's Name],

As discussed over multiple calls, we are proceeding with the SharePoint Framework (SPFx) approach for migrating the existing SharePoint Hosted Add-In application, in line with Microsoft’s retirement of the Add-In model.

Below is a summary of the proposed approach and high-level architecture.

---

1. Microsoft Recommended Approach – SharePoint Framework (SPFx)

SPFx is Microsoft’s modern development model for extending SharePoint Online. It enables building React-based web parts that run natively within SharePoint modern pages, without relying on the legacy Add-In (App Web) model.

High-Level Architecture

Current (Add-In Model):
SharePoint Site
→ Add-In (App Web)
→ ASPX / HTML Pages
→ JavaScript / jQuery
→ SharePoint Lists

Proposed (SPFx Model):
SharePoint Site
→ Modern Page
→ SPFx Web Part (React)
→ SharePoint Lists / Microsoft Graph

Key Changes:

- UI layer will be rebuilt using React within SPFx.
- App Web dependency will be eliminated.
- Authentication will leverage SharePoint context (no custom token plumbing required).
- Deployment will be handled via SharePoint App Catalog.
- Feature-by-feature migration approach to reduce risk.

This approach aligns with Microsoft’s long-term roadmap and ensures the application remains supported and compliant.

2. Migration Strategy (High-Level)

- Set up SPFx development environment.
- Rebuild application UI feature-by-feature as SPFx web parts.
- Create modern SharePoint pages to host the new web parts.
- Validate functionality alongside the existing Add-In.
- Gradually transition users and decommission the Add-In.

This avoids a big-bang rewrite and enables controlled rollout.

3. Risks and Considerations

- We currently do not have deep SPFx/SharePoint expertise within the team.
- There is a learning curve associated with SPFx tooling, deployment model, and SharePoint governance.
- The existing application is approximately 10 years old, which may introduce hidden App Web or permission dependencies.

To mitigate these risks, the idea is to:

- Get this approach validated by someone with proven SPFx expertise.
- Ensure architectural guidance is available at the beginning.
- Have ongoing support throughout the engagement to address technical and governance-related challenges.

This will reduce implementation risk and help avoid architectural missteps early in the migration.

Please let me know if you would like a more detailed migration roadmap, effort estimation, or a technical spike plan to validate assumptions.
