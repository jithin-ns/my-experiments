Dear [Supervisor's Name],

As discussed over multiple calls, we propose proceeding with the SharePoint Framework (SPFx) approach for migrating the existing SharePoint Hosted Add-In application, in line with Microsoft’s retirement of the Add-In model.

In addition, the new solution will adopt Microsoft Entra ID–based authentication to align with modern security and compliance standards.

---

Proposed Approach

The current application relies on the legacy Add-In (App Web) model, which is being retired by Microsoft. To ensure long-term support and stability, the application UI will be rebuilt using SPFx (React-based web parts) and hosted directly within modern SharePoint pages.

High-Level Architecture

Current:
SharePoint Site
→ Add-In (App Web)
→ Custom Pages
→ SharePoint Lists

Proposed:
SharePoint Site
→ Modern Page
→ SPFx Web Part (React)
→ Entra ID Authentication
→ SharePoint Lists / APIs

Key Improvements:

- Removal of deprecated Add-In model.
- Modern, Microsoft-supported development framework (SPFx).
- Secure authentication using Microsoft Entra ID.
- Controlled deployment via SharePoint App Catalog.
- Feature-by-feature migration to reduce implementation risk.

This approach ensures compliance with Microsoft’s roadmap while minimizing architectural disruption.

Risks and Support Requirement

- The team currently does not have deep SPFx expertise.
- There is a learning curve associated with SPFx development and Entra ID configuration.
- The existing application is approximately 10 years old and may contain legacy dependencies.

To mitigate these risks, we recommend:

- Validating the proposed architecture with an SPFx expert.
- Securing architectural guidance during the initial phase.
- Ensuring ongoing technical support throughout the engagement.

This will help reduce risk, avoid design missteps, and ensure a smooth transition.

Please let me know if you would like a phased migration plan and preliminary effort estimation prepared for review.
